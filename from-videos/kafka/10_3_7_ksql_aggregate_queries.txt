ksql> select count(*) from ATM

# Needs group by --- why? Itâ€™s impossible for a steam of data to provide a total. The data is continuous, so it cannot produce a grand total.

ksql> select location, count(*) as transaction_count from ATM group by location;

# we see output, but what are actually seeing here?
# After more data goes by it should be more more apparent, we are seeing a new row for each message in the stream, 
# but the output is a running count from the beginning of the query!

# maybe you want to persist this:
ksql> create stream counts_by_location as select location, count(*) as transaction_count 
from ATM group by location;

# Invalid result type your SELECT produces a table? Huh?
